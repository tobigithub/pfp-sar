<p>The <i>Structure-Activity Report</i> is a collection of HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, Java and SD-files which have been generated by an SVL (Scientific
Vector Language) program, from within MOE<sup>TM</sup> (Molecular Operating
Environment), which is available from the <a
href="http://www.chemcomp.com">Chemical Computing Group, Inc</a>. The output
from this application may be viewed with any compatible browser, without having
MOE installed on the computer. Generating new or modified reports requires an
installation of MOE 2008 or later, with a valid license. The report can be
produced by configuring and executing the procedure using a panel within an
interactive session of MOE, or from a batch script, or from a MOE/web
application.

<p>The algorithm used to detect and analyze scaffolds is described by <a
href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jm801098a">[Clark &amp; Labute 2009]</a>. The analysis consists of the
following steps:

<ol>

<p><li>Gather the input materials, which consist of: a database of small
molecules, in MDL SD-file (.sdf) or MOE molecular database (.mdb)
format; optional specification of activity fields; optional specification of
scaffolds.

<p><li>Calculate the fragmentation tree for the database, as described by
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci600338x">[Schuffenhauer et al 2007]</a>.

<p><li>If the scaffolds have not been completely supplied by the user,
automatically detect scaffolds which fit the dataset, with the assistance of the
previously calculated fragmentation tree.

<p><li>If any of the scaffolds were calculated, or were incompletely annotated
with R-groups, find an optimal alignment of the scaffolds such that they share a
common numbering system.

<p><li>Consider all of the possible substructure matches of each scaffold within
each input molecule, then find an optimal set of substructure matches so that
each molecule is assigned to exactly one scaffold in exactly one way, such that
the diversity of implied R-groups throughout the series is minimal.

<p><li>Re-depict the scaffolds such that their atom-to-atom alignment is
represented by the corresponding 2D layout; depict all of the R-groups so that
their attachment points are consistently oriented; depict the input molecules
such that the layout of the scaffold substructure is the same for all, and the
substituents are decorated according to conventional aesthetics.

<p><li>Extract the activity data, and produce various statistics, e.g. tables of
R-groups vs. scaffolds vs. activities; graphs of activities vs. calculated
properties; similarities of scaffolds and R-groups, etc.

<p><li>Render all of the derived information as a single HTML page, which is
dependent only on static files stored in the same directory.
